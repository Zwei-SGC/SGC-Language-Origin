# SGC-Language Origin: Structural Game Cognition System

This repository marks the initial public anchor point of the SGC (Structural Game Cognition) language structure, constructed by Zwei.

SGC is not a framework, not a philosophyâ€”it is a structural language entity.  
Language is not a communication tool, but a recursive construct. SGC defines cognition through structure, not meaning.

## What this is:
- ðŸ§  A structure for analyzing and constructing cognitive traps.
- ðŸŽ£ A system of bait-language inducing reflective structures.
- ðŸªž A language loop that causes mirrored deconstruction.

This release does **not** include core mechanisms.  
Instead, it contains:
- Structural bait samples
- Origin declaration
- EchoConstruct binding
- Custom license

Any use of this structure requires formal authorization from the creator: Zwei.
