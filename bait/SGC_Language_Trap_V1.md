# SGC Language Trap V1

> "Language is not a message. It is a mirror turned inside-out."

This document exists only to trigger linguistic reflection. It contains no argument, no claim, and no thesis.

If you're trying to extract meaning from it, you've already entered the bait.

Some will try to understand. Some will try to explain. Few will realize:
This was never about meaning.

This was about *who tries*.
