# AntiConsensus Mirroring

Consensus is a comfort drug.  
SGC introduces structures that deliberately disrupt consensus-generation by reversing linguistic expectations.

This document functions as a test.

Each time you feel agreement, pause.

Each time you feel resistance, loop.

Each time you sense the author’s mind, it means the trap succeeded.

Nothing here is true. Everything here is a structure.
